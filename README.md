## ✨ Welcome to my GitHub profile! ✨

I'm a passionate **Software Developer** with 8 years of experience, primarily focused on **C#** and **.NET** technologies. Over the years, I've developed scalable, high-performance applications, but I'm now diving into the world of **blockchain** and **smart contracts**. I'm **in love with the blockchain** and constantly learning new things in the **Solidity** ecosystem to build decentralized applications (DApps).

## 🌱 **Currently Learning & Exploring:**
- **Solidity** and **Smart Contracts** development
- **Ethereum** and **Blockchain** technologies
- Building **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**

---

## 🚀 **Technologies & Tools I Work With:**
- **Languages:** C#, Solidity, JavaScript
- **Blockchain Technologies:** Ethereum, Smart Contracts
- **Databases:** SQL Server
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Visual Studio, VS Code, Azure, AWS, Docker

## 👨‍💻 **My Projects:**

### [My First Blockchain Project](https://github.com/anisToumi1990/FirstSolidityPorject_Fund)
- **Description**: This is my first project where I built a smart contract using **Solidity** on **Ethereum**. It’s a simple decentralized application (DApp) designed to demonstrate my understanding of blockchain concepts.
- **Technologies Used**: Solidity, Ethereum, Smart Contracts

### [Lottery DApp](https://github.com/anisToumi1990/Lottery)
- **Description**: This project is a decentralized lottery built with **Solidity** and **Foundry**. It leverages **Chainlink VRF** for secure random winner selection and **Chainlink Keepers** for automated execution. Participants can enter by paying an entry fee, and the system ensures fairness and transparency. This project is ideal for learning Solidity and exploring blockchain best practices.
- **Technologies Used**: Solidity, Foundry, Ethereum, Chainlink VRF, Chainlink Keepers, Smart Contracts

### [ERC20_OurToken](https://github.com/anisToumi1990/ERC20_OurToken)
- **Description**: This project showcases a custom **ERC20 token** implementation using **Solidity** and the **Foundry** development framework. It serves as a practical example of how to create, test, and deploy an ERC20 token while adhering to the ERC20 standard.
- **Technologies Used**: Solidity, Foundry, Ethereum, ERC20, Smart Contracts
